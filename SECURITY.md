## Reporting a Vulnerability
Although Ingredients doesn't save any personal user data, I take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in identifying and addressing them. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in my web app or API, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Confirm the vulnerability:** Before reporting a potential security vulnerability, please make sure it is a genuine issue. I encourage you to test thoroughly and ensure that the behavior you're observing is indeed a security vulnerability.

2. **Privately notify me:** Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing me at security@ingredients.work. Please refrain from disclosing the vulnerability publicly until I had an opportunity to address it.

3. **Provide necessary details:** When reporting the vulnerability, please include detailed information such as:
    - A brief description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    - Any proof-of-concept or exploit code, if applicable.
    - Any other relevant details that could help us understand and address the issue.

Since this is a small, hobby, and non-profit project, Ingredients does not have a bug bounty program. Any reported vulnerabilities will be published and credited to you, if you want.

**Thank you for helping me keep Ingredients safe and secure for all users.** ‚ù§Ô∏è
