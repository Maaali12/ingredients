### Adding/changing/removing ingredients

Ingredients (or technologies) make this project so powerful. They're basically filters, which check for certain mentions of code/packages/domains/headers to decide whether a website is using the ingredient (or technology).

If you would like to add ingredients, follow the ["How to add Ingredients"](https://github.com/berrysauce/ingredients?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-how-to-add-ingredients) guide. Please also fork the repository and when you're done, submit a pull request.

**An ingredient consists of:**
- a `.json`file with the ingredient's information
- a `.png` icon (32px x 32px)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you're adding a new category (a new folder inside the [ingredients/](https://github.com/berrysauce/ingredients/tree/main/ingredients) folder) remember to add it to the `categories.json` file (inside the [ingredients/](https://github.com/berrysauce/ingredients/tree/main/ingredients) folder). Insert your new category in **ALPHABETICAL ORDER** & **BEFORE "Other"**.
