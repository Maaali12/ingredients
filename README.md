Ingredients is a website scanner that is able to determine the "ingredients" of a website, like the server, host, framework, libraries, widgets, etc.

It is an online tool designed to identify the technologies that power websites. It helps users discover the various software, frameworks, content management systems, analytics tools, and other technologies that are used to build and maintain a particular website.
